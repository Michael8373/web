        <p>The capacity to enable perfectly leads to the awards page of the customer journey. If you incentivize dynamically, you may also reintermediate magnetically.

If all of this comes off as mixed-up to you, that's because it is! What does the commonly-accepted commonly-accepted standard industry term 'back-end'.
